Welcome to my homepage! <br>
I am a second-year Ph.D student in <a href="https://www.math.pku.edu.cn">School of Mathematical Sciences</a> at Peking University, where I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/dingjian/index.html">Jian Ding</a>. Previously, I obtained my B.S. degree in mathematics from Peking University.  <br>
My research interest lies in the intersection of probability, high-dimensional statistics and theoretical computer science. <br>
